## About Me

Hi. I am Thomas Vuillaume and I am a scientist working at LAPP, CNRS.
I hold a master in engineering and a PhD in astrophysics that led me to data science.
I like to study systems, find a coherent story behind their behaviour and share it in a didactic way. I currently work on the development of high performance data analysis algorithms and on the data management of the upcoming astronomy infrastructures such as the [Cherenkov Telescope Array](https://www.cta-observatory.org/). I am also leading the data integration task under European mission [ASTERICS](https://www.asterics2020.eu/).
I work in a very collaborative environment including a large variety of profiles and often supervise students. Communication and pedagogy have been central in all my professional experiences.

I am passionate about mountaineering sports, photography and travels.
