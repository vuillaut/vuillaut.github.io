      An Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), is a compact object situated at the
      center of a galaxy and showing very bright emission at some or at
      every wavelengths. The only known phenomenon capable of producing
      enough energy to explain such luminosities is the accretion of matter
      on a supermassive black hole. One can as well observe relativistic
      jets of sizes comparable to the one of the host galaxy. In models I am
      interested in, the bright emission is directly due to these jets. My
      work consists in describing the physical processes occuring in the jet
      in order to explain and describe the observed emission.

			<h2>The two-flow model</h2>

		<div class="content">
			<p>
			During my Ph.D. thesis, supervised by Gilles Henri and Pierre-Olivier
	        Petrucci at IPAG, I have worked on improving the<b> two-flow </b> model. In
	        this model, the jet is composed of two fluids:<br/>
	        - a MHD sheath midly relativistic and carrying most of the power <br/>
	        - an inner, highly relativstic, leptonic jet reponsible for the
	        non-thermal emission observed.

		      <p>
		      I contributed to the development of a numerical model corresponding to the two-flow.
		      An important part of my work has been to find analytical and numerical approximations to increase the efficiency of the model and its usability in an acceptable computing time.

		      Interesting results include the study of the acceleration of the inner

		      an AGN created by the accretion disc, the dusty torus and the broad
		      line region induce variation of the speed of the flow along the jet
		      (with acceleration and deceleration zones). These variations are
		      crucial as they can result in modulation of the emission in space and
		      in time.

		        In order to optimize the model on actual data, I had to develop an

		        to deal with complex behavior in numerous dimensions.
		        Here is a little animation of an optimization of the model (orange
		        thick line) compared to data (crosses). Generation after generation,
		        the model improves itself by finding parameters that better fit the
		        data.
